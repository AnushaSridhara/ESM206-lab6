## Example of a rank-based test

We'll make our own samples using a pseudorandom generator (using set.seed)

```{r}
set.seed(1414)
gp_1 <- sample.int(20, size=15, replace=TRUE)

set.seed(1424)
gp_2 <- sample.int(30, size=15, replace=TRUE)
```

## built in function to make quick histogram using hist(file_name) (these below don't look normal)
```{r}
hist(gp_1)

hist(gp_2)
```

## try a t-test
```{r}
t.test(gp_1,gp_2)
```
What is the meaning of the p-value?
If these samples were drawn from the populations with same mean, the probablility of taking two random samples with means *at least as different* as the sample means we found by random chance (taking into account spread, n) is 19.8%. Therefore we do not have sufficient evidence and therefore retain (fail to reject) the null hypothesis. there is no significant difference in means between group 1 and group 2.
Warning : people get weirdly upset if you say :accept" the null hypothesis


Now let's compare this outcome to a rank based test

## Mann Whitney U unpaired rank-based test

```{r}
mwu <- wilcox.test(gp_1, gp_2)

mwu
```

If these samples were drawn from the populations with same ranks (medians), the probablility of finding two samples with ranks *at least as different* as those in our samples is 0.28 or 28%. 
There is no significant difference in ranks (medians) between groups 1 and 2 (statistical summary)
Therefore we do not have sufficient evidence and therefore retain (fail to reject) the null hypothesis. 

Median scores for group 1 (M = 14) and group 2 (M=12) did not differ significantly (Mann Whitney U test: U(df) = 86, p=0.28).


## Linear Regression 

Simple Linear regression (single dependent variable, a single independent variable)

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Make an exploratory plot of penguin body mass (y-axis) versus flipper length (x-axis)

ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Find a linear regression model using ordinary least squares describing the relationship between flipper length and body mass for these penguins.

3 pieces:

- What type of model are we using?
- What is the relationship to model (DV ~ IV(s))
- Where is the data that's used to create this model?

```{r}
penguin_lm <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins)
```

### broom package returns model outputs as tidy data frames 
```{r}
penguin_lm_tidy <- broom::tidy(penguin_lm)

penguin_lm_tidy

broom::glance(penguin_lm) # refer to wednesday's lecture - 3rd nov
```

How can I actually include my model equation in a report?

```{r}
extract_eq(model=penguin_lm, use_coefs = TRUE)
```
### plot on a linear model; helps 
```{r}
plot(penguin_lm)
```






## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
